# 📊 Excel Analyst Formulas Practice

This project contains an Excel workbook where I practiced a focused set of powerful formulas often used in real-world data analysis and reporting workflows.

## 💡 Formulas Practiced

The workbook includes practical applications of the following formulas:

- `IFERROR`
- `LEFT`, `MID`, `RIGHT` (Text extraction)
- `CONCATENATE`
- `SEQUENCE`
- `EDATE` (Date calculations)
- `LARGE` (Top-N logic)
- `SUMIFS` (Conditional aggregation)
- `FILTER` (Dynamic array filtering)
- `XLOOKUP` (Modern lookup)
- `INDEX` (Reference-based data retrieval)

Each formula is used in context with real-life style examples for tasks like:
- Extracting portions of text from data columns
- Handling errors gracefully in lookup scenarios
- Performing conditional aggregation (e.g., total by category)
- Dynamically retrieving records or generating sequences
- Returning values based on multiple match conditions
